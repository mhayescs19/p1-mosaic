## Population Simulation Project
### OVERVIEW ([PROJECT PLAN LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFTt2SqCLsW6-2fDmcQppuPO6XvYHVz6I5cnbozqs2U/edit?usp=sharing))
Increase in population is determined by dot interaction (event based), while decrease is based on time. A simple simulation that models the change of population based on factors such as rate of reproduction, death, and interaction. Algorithms will be used to adjust each personâ€™s chances of dying or reproducing based on their age and interaction with one another. If time allows, an algorithm that introduces a virus in the middle of the simulation will be added in order to model the change of population in the middle of a pandemic environment. At the end of the simulation, a data table will be displayed with data such as average increase in population over the years, notable increases or decreases in population with year number, in number of deaths a year, in offspring produced, etc. A database will be added in the future to store simulation data from multiple simulations.
